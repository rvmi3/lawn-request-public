Lawn Request:

This web application allows users to request landscaping services from other users providing them.

If you want to use this application on your local machine you will need two things:

    1. A running local mongodb server
    2. Node.js installed

This project was originally going to be a junk pickup website where users can find junk and collect it for free.

I wanted to experiment with a bit more functionality so I transitioned into this idea. 

Some functions include, emailer, live chatting, user authentication/verification, password resetting, storing session information, custom csrf tokens and many more.

I also had some experience with API's like stripe and Courier but they didnt make it to publishing. 

Please send me feedback on the project with improvements/critiques because Im still working on updates and improvements.

Thank you! 

P.S. updates will be posted in a seperate update file.
